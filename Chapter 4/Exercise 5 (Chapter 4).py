favorite_fruits = input("Enter your favorite fruit: ") #This code asks the user what their favorite fruit is
 
favorite_fruits = ['strawberry', 'peaches', 'mango'] #I made a list of my three favorite fruits and called it "favorite_fruits"
#I made a list of my favorite fruits, and then wrote a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in the list. 
if 'strawberry' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like strawberry!")
if 'apples' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like apples!")
if 'blueberries' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like blueberries!")
if 'mango' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like mango!")
if 'peaches' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like peaches!")
#I wrote five if statements and each of them checks whether a certain kind of fruit is in my list. If the fruit is in my list, the if block should print a string,such as "You really like bananas!""
